# MTC-SUSA
Plan Bay Area 2050 was a project the Metropolitan Transportation Commission done with the help of the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association at UC Berkeley.  Our group was tasked with creating a map visualization that would display insights and trends from MTC's projection of the future of the Bay Area.  Unfortunately, as project goals were shifted midway, SUSA's project was cancelled and work was halted.  These jupyter notebooks contained some of the work and findings of the project.
